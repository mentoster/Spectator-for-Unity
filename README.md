# Spectator-for-Unity
____
## For what it's made
 1. This asset was made for spectators, they can watch the player while he is playing the game.
 2. But it's probably not very interesting? Yes!
 3. So you can interact with the player:
     1. Travel with the controller!
     2. Perhaps you would like to show where you are?  So do it! Use (default  E-button)>:
           - Skins:
             - ![eye](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/mentoster/Spectator-for-Unity/master/images/eye.png) 
             - ![svidetel](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/mentoster/Spectator-for-Unity/master/images/svid.png)
             - ![rodinaslishat](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/mentoster/Spectator-for-Unity/master/images/Spy.png)
           - You can also block the sprite's rotation! 
     3. Perhaps you would like to give advice to the player, or make jokes about him?... Yes! You also can do it! Use (default  T-button):
          - Chatclouds!
